Conclusions
 
As we can see in the original algorithm of the Boston House Prices dataset where we use KNN to predict,
the mean square error is almost 52% which is very high to our goal, when we change our predictor for the
OLS linear regression, the difference is so big, the errors change to the 24%, that means is much better 
than the KNN. 
At the final, we try with the linear regression and we realize that the errors could be smaller,
We saw that the errors was around 21%. It allow us to conclude that for this classification problem,
the best model is a linear regression, although we know that for the classification problems, it isn't
always the rule.
